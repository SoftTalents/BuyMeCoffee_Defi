# Buy Me Coffee DApp

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

For simple test purpose on console, run below command.
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/buy-coffee.js
```

To deploy, run below command
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Goerli deploy is below.

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
